    <div><p>TrueDepth API - front face camera</p></div>
    <p>
      Application asks user permission to access camera upon starting first
      time. Application's core idea is to be able to move sprite in game without
      touching it. Front facing True-Depth camera API is needed in order to play
      this game. When game starts, the each video frame from camera, is analyze
      and identify face landmark (Nose) position. Later app use that feature to
      move the sprite position. Application does not store or share any data.
